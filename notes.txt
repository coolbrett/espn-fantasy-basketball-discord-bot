TO-DO 
-----
- Redo three-weeks
- Refactor scoreboard to be able to go further back than 2019
- Add descriptions to parameters of commands (I can't figure this out wtf)
- Look into adding logos next to team names on scoreboard (doubtful)
- Add /boxscore command to report player totals for a matchup -- thinking maybe report box score
- % of top (league roster size * (half number of teams in league)) players on roster -- avg and totals
- injury rate stat

BEGINNER TASKS
--------------
- Write a command that sends a saying based upon a random number
- Write a command that sends a message of a list of all the commands LeBot knows
- Write a basic README file using markdown that has a title, description, and authors listed

FUTURE WORK - once the bot is polished and bulletproof
-----------
- refactor and figure out an initial set up process so that this bot can be used
    for other H2H FBB leagues
- Add roto support??
- Add error handling for incorrect parameters for commands
- deploy the bot somewhere
- set up github actions for automated deployments

NOTES
-----
- If the FBB league is, or has ever been, a private league then you need to provide 
    espn_s2 and swid when building the league object -- instructions below
    (https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions/150)

- the /standings command on NBA Bot shows the limit on mobile
- NO COMMANDS THAT @ PEOPLE -- THAT SHIT IS ANNOYING
